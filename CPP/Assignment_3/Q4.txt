4. An electricity distribution company charges the electricity consumption, as follows:
(a) Fixed amount of Rs. 100
(b) For first 50 units, Rs. 1.5/unit
(c) For next 150 units, Rs. 2.0/unit
(d) For next 200 units, Rs. 3.0/unit
(e) For every next unit, Rs. 4.5/unit
Write a program that reads electricity consumption in number of units and calculates and displays the bill.
