7. Write a program to take input from three students (one by one) - 
their names and marks obtained (out of maximum of 500).
Then calculate their percentages and print in the form:
<student name1> scored x.x%
<student name2> scored x.x%
<student name3> scored x.x%
[Note: i) Avoid using loops as we have not yet covered them. ii) Maximum marks is fixed to 500.]
