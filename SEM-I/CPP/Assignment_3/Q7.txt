// Example program
/*

7. Write a program that reads three integers(i.e. a,b and c) one after the other, not all together. 
The program should force the user to enter the numbers in decending order (i.e. a > b > c)i.e. the program should exit only after user has entered the numbers that in decending order and the program has displayed the numbers.
